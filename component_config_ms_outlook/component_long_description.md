This extractor allows you to automatically retrieve email contents and/or it's attachments from Office 365.
It supports incremental loads and IMAP query to define specific criteria and uses oAuth 2.0 for authentication.

- Emails stay intact in your original inbox
- Emails can be queried using a standardized [query syntax](https://help.keboola.com/components/extractors/communication/email-imap/query-syntax).
