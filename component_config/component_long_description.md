This extractor allows you to automatically retrieve email contents and/or it's attachments via the [IMAP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol). 
It supports incremental loads and IMAP query to define specific criteria. 

The IMAP protocol provides several advantages:

- Emails stay intact in your original inbox
- Emails can be queried using a standardized [query syntax](https://help.keboola.com/components/extractors/communication/email-imap/query-syntax).
- Can be used with *almost* any provider, so it will work with Gmail as well as with Outlook and others.
